# Project_RNA

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to compute coarse-grained RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) and analyze its correlation with three existing metrics: 
- RMSD: Root Mean Square Deviation
- MCQ: Max Cluster Quality
- TM-Score: Template Modeling Score

The main question we aim to address is: 
Which coarse-grained representation has the highest correlation to current metrics?

## Objectives

1. Compute coarse-grained RMSD using a custom implementation.
2. Analyze correlation scores between coarse-grained RMSD and the metrics (RMSD, MCQ, TM-Score).
